K-Knowledge-Our most valuable resource is our people's knowledge. In order to gain access to valuable information and deliver better results, we love to share our knowledge and experience!
O-Objective-Define the goal, communicate it out and track it. We strive to get everyone rowing in the same direction, something we consider to be essential for getting high performance!
D-Diversity-You are welcome, no matter your age, gender, nationality or language. We want you to feel respected and valued so that together we can build strong relationships and be more productive in what we do!
I-Intelligence-Two people are always smarter than one. We communicate about issues and problems to come up with a better and more effective solution!
U-Understanding-We try to understand our colleague's needs and wants with regular 1-on-1 feedback sessions. The input we get helps us build a friendlier environment but also one catered to active career development!
S-Social-Itâ€™s not all about business. Relax, be a friend, drink a beer, build a strong relationship. It makes it easier to do real work.
